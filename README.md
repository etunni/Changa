# The Changa Fonts Project

This information should be distributed along with the Changa fonts and any derivative works.

Changa is a typeface family intended for headlines, titles and other display settings and supports the Latin and Arabic scripts.

The Latin was developed with a singular height so that you can create display texts with minimum line spacing.
The lowercase has short ascenders and descenders and the letters are inscribed within a square. 
The uppercase is also sturdy and squat. 
The counter shapes are rectangular, featuring small curves in opposite vertexes which accompany and break the shapes, evoking a contemporary style.

The Arabic was also drawn by Eduardo Tunni in Buenos Aires in collaboration with M. Gaber in Cairo.

Changa could be expanded to support other styles and scripts.

Changa is available from Google Fonts at http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Changa
